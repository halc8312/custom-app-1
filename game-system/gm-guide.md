# Game Master Guide

## üéØ The GM's Role

As a Game Master in GitHub Chronicles, you are:
- **Narrator**: Describe the world and its reactions
- **Referee**: Interpret rules fairly
- **Collaborator**: Build stories with players
- **Facilitator**: Keep the game fun and moving

## üé≤ Core GM Principles

### 1. Say "Yes, And..." or "No, But..."
- **Yes, And...**: "You hack the terminal, AND you discover a hidden file"
- **No, But...**: "You can't break the encryption, BUT you notice a backdoor"

### 2. Fail Forward
Failure should create new opportunities:
- Failed hack? Security is alerted (new challenge)
- Failed negotiation? Make an enemy (future plot)
- Failed jump? Fall into unknown area (exploration)

### 3. Player Agency Matters
- Let players' choices shape the world
- Unexpected solutions are often the best
- If players bypass your content, let them

### 4. Rulings Over Rules
- If a rule slows the game, make a quick decision
- Consistency matters more than perfection
- Document rulings for future reference

## üé≠ Running Scenes

### Scene Structure
1. **Establish**: Where, when, who, what's happening
2. **Complicate**: What makes this interesting/challenging
3. **Resolve**: Players act, consequences unfold
4. **Transition**: Lead to next scene naturally

### Scene Types

#### Action Scenes
- Keep pace fast
- Describe cinematically
- Everyone gets spotlight time
- Environmental hazards add spice

#### Investigation Scenes
- Multiple clues lead to truth
- Failure finds different clues
- Red herrings with purpose
- Players' theories can become real

#### Social Scenes
- NPCs have goals too
- Body language matters
- Subtext and secrets
- Relationships have consequences

#### Exploration Scenes
- Reward curiosity
- Hidden treasures and dangers
- Environmental storytelling
- Maps are suggestions

## üé® Creating NPCs

### Quick NPC Generator
Roll or choose:

**Personality Trait + Quirk + Goal = NPC**

**Traits**: Nervous, Bold, Suspicious, Helpful, Grumpy, Mysterious
**Quirks**: Speaks in code, Glitches, Obsessive, Forgetful, Paranoid, Cheerful
**Goals**: Get rich, Find truth, Gain power, Help others, Survive, Have fun

### Making NPCs Memorable
- **Voice**: Type differently (CAPS, no punctuation, emojis)
- **Motivation**: What do they want?
- **Secret**: What are they hiding?
- **Connection**: How do they relate to PCs?

### NPC Stat Blocks

**Minion** (1-hit enemies)
- HP: 1
- Attack: 2d6+1
- Damage: 1d6
- One simple ability

## üó∫Ô∏è Adventure Design

2. **Puzzle**: Mental challenge
3. **Trick/Setback**: Unexpected complication
4. **Climax**: Big fight/confrontation
5. **Reward/Revelation**: Treasure/plot twist

### Adventure Hooks
- **Personal**: Ties to character backstory
- **Urgent**: Time pressure
- **Mysterious**: Unanswered questions
- **Rewarding**: Clear benefits
- **Threatening**: Danger if ignored

### Balancing Encounters
- **Easy**: DC 6, Enemies with -1 modifiers
- **Medium**: DC 8, Enemies with +0 modifiers
- **Hard**: DC 10, Enemies with +2 modifiers
- **Deadly**: DC 12, Enemies with +4 modifiers

## üéØ GM Techniques

### The Three Clue Rule
For any critical information:
1. Provide at least 3 ways to find it
2. Different skills access different clues
3. Failure on one reveals another path

### Quantum Ogre Principle
That cool encounter? It happens wherever players go:
- Prepare situations, not locations
- Encounters follow story needs
- Player choice still matters for context

### Yes/No Oracle
When unsure, let dice decide:
- 2d6: 2-6 = No, 7-9 = Yes but..., 10-12 = Yes
- Modify for likelihood (+2 likely, -2 unlikely)

### Fronts and Threats
Track what happens if players don't intervene:
1. **Warning Signs**: NPCs mention problem
2. **Escalation**: Problem gets worse
3. **Crisis**: Immediate action needed
4. **Catastrophe**: Major consequences

### Random Complications (2d6)
| Roll | Complication |
|------|--------------|
| 2    | Betrayal revealed |

| 9-10 | Unexpected ally appears |
| 11   | Hidden connection found |
