# Tutorial Adventure: The Corrupted Core

**Session Type**: Tutorial/One-shot
**Difficulty**: Beginner
**Players**: 1-4 players
**Status**: Ready to Start
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

## üéØ Adventure Hook
Strange glitches have been appearing in the Tutorial District of Gitopolis. NPCs are freezing mid-sentence, textures are flickering, and some areas are becoming inaccessible. The System Administrator has put out a call for brave adventurers to investigate the source of these corruptions before they spread to the main city.

## üìç Starting Location
**The Hello World Tavern** - A cozy establishment in the Tutorial District where new adventurers gather. The tavern's sign flickers between "Hello World" and "H3ll0 W@rld" - clearly affected by the corruption.

## üé≠ Background
The Tutorial District was created as a safe space for new users to learn the basics of the digital realm. It's usually the most stable area in all of Gitopolis, protected by multiple failsafes. If corruption can take hold here, nowhere is safe.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Expected Challenges
- Combat: Low (2-3 simple encounters)
- Puzzles: Low (1-2 basic puzzles)
- Social: Medium (NPC interactions)
- Exploration: Medium (investigating clues)

## üìã Requirements
- Character Level: 1 (perfect for new characters)
- Time Commitment: Single session
- Special: This is a learning adventure - mistakes are expected!

## üé¨ Opening Scene

*As you enter the Hello World Tavern, you notice the usual warmth seems diminished. The firewall in the corner sputters with inconsistent flames. Other patrons - mostly Tutorial NPCs - repeat their welcoming phrases with slight distortions.*

***Bartender.exe***: "Wel-wel-welcome to the Hello World Tav-tav-tavern! Can I get you a drink.drink.drink?"

*A stressed-looking woman in System Administrator robes approaches your table. Her badge reads "Admin Sarah - Tutorial District Manager".*

**Admin Sarah**: "Thank the Core you're here! I put out the emergency request just an hour ago. These glitches started three days ago, small at first - a repeated word here, a flickering texture there. But it's getting worse. This morning, an entire street rendered as null void. We evacuated the NPCs, but if this spreads..."

*She slides a data pad across the table showing a map of the district.*

**Admin Sarah**: "I've traced the strongest corruption signatures to three locations: the Old Repository Library, the Practice Combat Arena, and the Tutorial Mine. I don't have authorization to investigate myself - bureaucracy, you know. But freelancers like you... well, you can go wherever you need to. Find out what's causing this and stop it. The district's stability depends on you!"
