## Character Details
### Appearance
Zara has short, spiky silver hair with RGB LED highlights that change color based on her mood. She wears a modified QA uniform covered in patches from various software companies she's tested for. Her augmented eyes can zoom and display diagnostic data.

### Personality
Methodical and detail-oriented, Zara approaches problems systematically. She's suspicious of anything that seems "too good to be true" and always reads the fine print. Despite her serious demeanor, she has a dry sense of humor about bugs and glitches.

### Motivation
After discovering that a major corporation was deliberately introducing bugs to sell patches, Zara went rogue. She now hunts dangerous bugs that threaten the stability of the digital realms, seeking to make the world safer for all users.

### Backstory
Zara worked for MegaSoft Corp for five years, rising to Lead QA Tester. She discovered the "Planned Obsolescence Protocol" - a conspiracy to introduce bugs deliberately. When she tried to report it, she was marked as a "memory leak" for termination. She escaped into the Wild Zones and now works as a freelance bug hunter, helping those who can't afford corporate protection.
